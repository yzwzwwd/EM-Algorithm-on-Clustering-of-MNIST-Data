# EM-Algorithm-on-Clustering-of-MNIST-Data
Zhiwei Wang & Yuxiang Lin

**Main Tasks:**  
- Read the MINST data set in binary, and convert each image into a pixel value vector with a feature number of 784 as well as the label  
- Program EM algorithm separately under spherical and diagonal Gaussian mixture assumptions  
- Compare the clustering results with corresponding labels and analyze the rationality of each assumptions based on the comparison result
